## **[!] Work in progress | Alpha state** <br/>
Visual node editor, inspired by [Blender's shader editor](https://www.blender.org/), is a tool to visually build [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) materials using [Three.js-Shading-Language](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language).  The socket proximity detection was inspired by [Kennedy Richard](https://x.com/KennedyRichard)'s [Nodezator's node editor](https://x.com/KennedyRichard/status/1823905562192449762)

### :bookmark_tabs: Read the [WIKI / Documentation](https://github.com/bandinopla/three.js-visual-node-editor/wiki/three.js-TSL-Visual-Node-Editor) to collaborate!

# Let's build this together!
The idea is to let everybody add nodes and have this be the best shader node editor in the galaxy. To do so, you must check the [Three.js-Shading-Language Docs](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language) to know how to implement the TSL sintax.

You can also fix bugs or improve the code/interface. Just clone and do a pull request.

# == Nodes "done"... ==
These are the nodes currently "done" (room for improvement)...
- UV Channel
- Scene Preview
- (incomplete) MeshStandardNode shader node. ( only colorNode property )
- Image texture node
